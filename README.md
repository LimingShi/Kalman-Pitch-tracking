# Kalman-Pitch-tracking
Kalman pitch tracking for the paper "A Kalman-based fundamental frequency estimation algorithm"


Advantage: high temporal-frequency resolution.


Disadvantage: fixed harmonic order (valid for short segment), sensitive to initialization (good coarse pitch estimate, pitch variance and amplitude variance settings).
