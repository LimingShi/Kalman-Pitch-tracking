# Kalman-Pitch-tracking
Kalman pitch tracking for the paper "A Kalman-based fundamental frequency estimation algorithm, WASPAA 2017"


Advantage: high temporal-frequency resolution.


Disadvantage: fixed harmonic order (valid for short segment), sensitive to initialization (Initial pitch estimate, noise variance, pitch variance and amplitude variance settings).
